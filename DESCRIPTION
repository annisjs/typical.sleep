Description: Finds the typical sleep period in three steps: 
    1. Finds relevant sleep logs are those that fall within +/-8 hours of the midsleep point. 
    2. Determines the median bedtime and waketime from the relevant logs.
    3. Labels each sleep log as either part of the typical sleep period or not by filtering out those
    that are outside of the bedtime/waketime interval.
